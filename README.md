Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
    
    Logic Tutor is a computer-assisted training app to improve logic and critical thinking skills, tutoring the user on advanced strategies in classic logic games like chess and sudoku. The app presents real-time strategic hints from the computer to advance the user's game strategy, and tracks learning progress using real-time automated tools.

  
Motivation: why are you working on this project?
        
    1.) This project appears managable to the skill levels of the members of the Hooli Strike Team.
    
    2.) Logic games are difficult to learn on your own. Computer assisted learning technologies can help users improve their 
        skills in Sudoku or Chess and help them track their learning achievements using specialized tools. 
    
      Suggestions (Tory):
    
      1.) Personal growth and impact: the project offers ample opportunity for team members with varying levels of experience to make meaningful contributions to the product.  Additionally, the challenge of designing a web application that is as enjoyable as it is effective at teaching complex concepts supports the team members in honing their development skills.

      2.) Integration of education and enjoyment: logic games are a long-standing and widespread pastime. The project leverages their popularity for educational and entertainment purposes by providing users with an engaging way to enhance their problem-solving abilities.
      
      3.) Empowering learning through technology: computer-assisted learning lessens the burden on users of managing their individual paths to mastery.  Access to instant feedback, progress tracking features, and achievements encourages desired behaviors from users by making them more meaningful and rewarding.

Risks to project completion; possibly including new language or working environment no prior experience working with 
these team members, lack of some needed resources, etc:
        
    -Team member schedule conflicts
    
    -Lack of familiarity with front-end game development
        
    -Lack of experience or familiarity with certain logic games
        
    -Difficulties agreeing on requirements, features, and timelines of completion

        
Mitigation Strategy for above risks (Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!)
        
    1.) Agile-Scrum: weekly sprints, design meetings, review and team retrospective meetings.
        
    2.) Pair-Programming: meeting in pairs to work on sections of the project.
        
    3.) Test-Driven Development: writing tests that demonstrate satisfactory performance with respect to user requirements.
